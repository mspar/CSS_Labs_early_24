## Reading in data and loading packages

```{r}
library(tidyverse)


# here I load in the data. To not have any issues with how the .txt file is structured I remove everything but the data and add the column names manually

data <- as.data.frame(read_table(file = "C:/Users/marcs/Desktop/Labs/CSS_Labs_early_24/SNA/AssignmentsSNA/Email-Enron.txt",
                   skip = 4,
                   col_names = c("FromNodeID","ToNodeID")))
```
