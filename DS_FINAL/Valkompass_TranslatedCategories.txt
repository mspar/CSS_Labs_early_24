This dataset was produced in 2014 by SverigesTelevision (Swedish National television). 
It includes a list of all the candidates to the Parliament (Parliament). Information about their income were gathered from the tax office (Skattesverket). 
Then, all candidates were contacted and they were asked to respond to question about themselves, their political affiliations, their employment. 
Eventually, they were asked about their political opinion on 45 questions that divide contemporary Sweden. For each, they were also asked if they thought this is a priority question or not. 

The variables are listed below, I took care of some translation and some recoding this week - it could be horribly wrong, but i hope not. 
There a still bits in Swedish for those who want to have a taste of Scandinavia
